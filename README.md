# Kickstarter Analysis



## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help an up and coming playright Louise who wants to start a crowd funding campaign for her play "FEVER".
She has estimated a budget of $10,000.

The purpose of this project is to oraganize, sort and analyse different crowd funding campaigns and determine the parameter's needed by Louise to make her a crowd funding campaign a success.


##Analysis and Challenges

###Analysis

Through out the course of this project we used Microsfot Excel and it's features to analyze the data from different Kickstarte Campaigns

We used different mathematical formaulas incorporated in Excel that came in handy in calucations. Be it Calucalting averages, finding Sum and percentages and 
finding descriptive stats like Mean median mode and standard deviation.

Conditional formatting syntaxes like IF, IFELSE and COUNTIFS were very useful in analysing the trends in outcomes for different campaigns.

Use of new fuctions like Years() and Date() to perform conversions related to date fields in the Datset.

Finally using pivot table and pivot charts helped analyse the data in a  informative picturesque way.
Using pivot table and charts helped eliminate all the unecessary data and provided information via line and bar chart
which helped analyse the trend in different categories and subcategories(in louise's case theater and plays) through differnt years and months.


###Challeneges

Though challenges were minimum but the biggest challenege was analysing the dataset as the number of data entries were huge.

Sorting anf filtering the data was a pain point but with help of freeze panes feature in Excel we were able to analyase the data more efficiently.

Another challenege was understanding new and different conditional formatting functions like COUNTIFS(), converting Unix timestamps to a readable date as this was the first
time using these functions in EXCEL so there was always a chance of not getting the desired result but the PRO TIP and HINTS in the module guided me through the entire process
and helped in understanding the use of these functions.



## Results



###Conclusions


####Conclusion 1( Based on Outomes vs Launch Date)

The first conclusion that we can draw from seeing the chart there is a considerable spike in successful outocomes where the parent category is theater
starting in the month of April till May and then it slowly tapers away for the subsequent months.

Number of failed campaigns for theater does not show a rise and fall trend given there is not much difference in the values for different months.


####Conclusion 2( Based on Outomes vs Launch Date)

Another conclusion that can be drawn from the chart is that Louise should try and host her play in the months between May and June as the number of successful plays are the most
in those months.


####Conclusion 3( Based on Outcomes Vs Goal)

The conclusion that can be drawn front the chart is that most successful plays have been with a goal between 1000 and 15000 as the success rate for plays within thses goal ranges is the best.

We also see that the success rate for plays with goal ranginfrom 35000 to 45000 also have a good success rate.
